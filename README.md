Climate variability is a critical element in the social research study affecting our lives.  For example,  it is critical to understand the current climate trend that exist in a topographical area so we can make relocation decisions.

We are aware that climate changes impact precipitation trends and water consumption in the Soutwestern United States, severe and sustained Drought, lanslide potential, moisture availability, and floods in the Southwestern U.S.

Coping with this long-term variability requires access to multiple datasets identifying climate variable values.  This is a difficult task that requires access to multiple data banks with required information for final tabulation.

There is not a single access to a dataset that can bring a single database result for quick data trend examination.
  
Our response to this climate issue is to develop a web based tool capable of addressing  the issue of climate variability with respect to temperature by presenting a graphical representation of selected "climate" trend from historical dataset analyzed to users selected variables.   Our project will attempt to provide meaningful and interesting climate predictions based on significant temperatures integrated into a single data presentation produced in a data-warehouse adquired from differing data.gov apiâ€™s and potentially other public climate data repositories.
